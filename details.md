##What is Career Day?
Career Day is a career exposure event for eighth grade students from six schools in the St. Louis area. The goal is for these students to learn more about a variety of careers and the educational paths needed to get to those careers.  

##What schools are participating in Career Day?
5 Catholic Schools (Marian Middle School, Loyola Academy, St. Cecilia, St. Louis the King, and Most Holy Trinity) as well as one charter school (La Salle Middle School) are participating.  These schools follow the NativityMiguel model of education. NativityMiguel schools have a mission to empower middle school students and to provide a unique, faith-based education that seeks to breaks the cycle of poverty for under-resourced students.  The NativityMiguel model provides a framework for success through an extended school day and year, small class sizes, and a Graduate Support Program that provides extended emotional, academic, social, and financial support throughout the students’ secondary and post-secondary educational journeys.   

##When and where is Career Day?

## Morning Career Exploration
In the morning, the three floors of the Maria Center will each have a theme – Health/Helping, Business/Corporate, Arts/Creative.  Students will be assigned to one floor based on their career interests and move from room to room to meet with professionals in groups of about 8 students.  Professionals will discuss their career and then answer questions from the students. Sessions last about 25 minutes with a 5 minute break in between each session. Professionals will meet with 4 different groups of students.

## What topics should I be prepared to talk about?
* Describe a day in the life of your job.
* Where you went to college, what you studied there, and how that relates (or doesn’t relate) to your current career.
* What you enjoy most (and least) about your job.
* Why you chose your career path.
* What your career path looks like for the future.
* What kind of rules/regulations surround your job (dress code, social media policies, continuing education, etc.)
* What should students do in high school/college/during the summer to prepare for a career in your field.
* Any advice you have for the students regarding college and/or career readiness.

## What should I bring with me? 
Your experience and time is the most valuable thing you can share with our students.  The students really respond to interactive presentations so if you can bring any tools/supplies you use at work or a project you completed the students would enjoy seeing it. If you would like to bring any small promotional materials for your company (pens, magnets, brochures, etc…), please feel free to do so.  Additionally, if you know of any ways that students can learn more about your profession or have a summer experience that is related to your field – please bring that with you.  There will be approximately 100 eighth grade students in attendance.

## Details
Good Afternoon!

Hope you are well.  Thank you again for your willingness to share about your career at our middle school career day on Tuesday March 8. The students are excited to meet you and learn about the steps they can take now to ensure their future success.

A few reminders and details...

You will present to 4 small groups of students for about 25 minutes each, between 9 am and 12 pm. You will have one break session during the rotations. We will have coffee and bagels available and you are welcome to stay for pizza.

The students respond particularly well to interactive presentations. If you have anything hands on that you can bring, please do so.  We have limited technology access (projectors, etc.) but let us know if you have a specific request. The students will also have many questions for you. 

The event is at the Maria Center - 336 E. Ripa Ave - on the campus of Notre Dame High School.  Do not come to Marian, La Salle or St. Cecilias!

We may pair you with another professional in a similar career so that students can see multiple perspectives on the same area of work. 

Please contact me if you have any additional questions!  Thank you again for sharing your time!
