* Introduce
  * Software engineer
  * Learned a lot on my own
* Sum integers...how fast can you go in 10 sec?
  * 1:1, 2:3, 3:6, 4:10, 5:15, 6:21, 7:28, 8:36, 9:45, 10:55, 11:66, 12:78, 13:91, 14:105, 15, 120
  * Fast algorithm
    * Even ((N/2)xN) + N/2 - (5x10) + 5
    * Odd (N/2+1) x N - (4+1) x 9
  * Write program (end with `easy_final.py`) ~ 70,000,000
  * Show advanced program (adder.py) ~ 80,000,000
  * Show GUI program (app.py)
  * Show C++ program ~ 1,000,000,000 in 0.6sec
* Build HTML Page (`basic_page.html`)
* Add javascript (`js_page.html`)
* Show github (if internet or screenshots)
